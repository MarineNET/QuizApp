# Udacity-Project-3-QuizApp
This is a simple project that consists of 1 Activity. This projects allowed me to get more confortable with different layouts and widgets 
such as Button, TextView, CheckBox, RadioButtons, and EditText. I also had a chance to work with for loops, Arrays, Switch statements, and
onClick Listeners.
